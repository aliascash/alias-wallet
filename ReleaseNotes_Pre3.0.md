## SPECTRECOIN V2

```By downloading and using this software, you agree that 1/6 of the staking rewards are contributed to a development fund. The development fund aims to support the long term development and value of Spectrecoin. The fund is managed by the Spectrecoin core team.```

This is a major release and a **MANDATORY** update to the Spectrecoin software! This update involves consensus changes (_details below_) and **you MUST update** your wallet software before:

21/08/2018 (_21th August 2018_) @ 2200 hours (GMT)

If you do not update your wallet software you will no longer be able to connect to the Spectrecoin network and you will no longer be able to conduct transactions on the network and you will no longer be able to deposit or withdraw your funds (XSPEC) from the exchanges.

### Development Contribution Blocks (DCB)
After 21/08/2018 @ 2200 hours (GMT) one in six (1 in 6) block rewards will be designated DCBs and will be sent to the Spectrecoin team development fund wallet. This fund will ensure a future for Spectrecoin and will enable us to pay for certain services and to hire contractors and to pay Spectrecoin core team members in XSPEC to enable them to work full time on the project. We have some long term projects and concepts to implement such as a new proof-of-stake algorithm we call Proof-of-Stealth to enable so called "stealth staking". These developments depend on a source of steady funding. We believe this will give us the opportunity to produce better software and will create value for investors. We currently have some very skilled developers working for us and we want to keep it that way.

### Replay Protection
We have implemented a check for DCBs and we have implemented a replay protection mechanism. This means that after 21/08/2018 @ 2200 hours (GMT) any wallets not updated will not be able to create transactions on the Spectrecoin V2 network.

## 2.1.0
- Tor is now integrated as a separate process.

- [#7](https://github.com/aliascash/alias-wallet/issues/7) For MacOS and Windows, a separate OBFS4 release is now available with preconfigured OBFS4 bridges. Note that the only difference between the OBFS4 release and the standard release is the file  **torrc-defaults** in the tor subfolder which configures OBFS4.
